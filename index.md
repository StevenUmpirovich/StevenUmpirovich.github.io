I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029. 

## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

* Lab 6 Part 2

    Lab 6 Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it involves the card game blackjack. Back when I was young around 7-8 or so, I used to play a variety of card games against my grandfather who has since passed away and my father. I remember distinctly enjoying blackjack because it was one of the few card games aside from Poker that I could beat my family in. Thus when I saw the lab be associated with blackjack it made me more passionate about the lab. I learned about how calculations worked in C++ through this lab and that is something that was very helpful in the later labs as well. 

* Lab 2.

    While the lab itself wasn’t the most necessarily exciting or glamorous, it was the first true lab I would say as lab 1 was more about learning how linux works then anything else. There’s something special about that feeling of getting something to properly work, and do so correctly that really, really makes computer science feel worth it to me, and is the main source of satisfaction I strive for in this major. I learned how to commit, clone, and push using git with this lab which obviously is something majorly important throughout this class. 

* Lab 10

    To be quite honest this lab is here not because of the lab itself but because of the struggles that my partner and I went through, especially the formatting. The lab was very difficult for my partner and I and required extensive collaboration to complete, with us butting heads often and trying to figure out solutions on our own. This so far has been the only lab that took me the entire class period to complete, and when it finally worked I had never felt such a sense of relief and joy. This lab taught me not something necessarily important about coding (however it did do that too) but what I want to highlight was how this class taught me patience, resilience, and how to work through a difficult problem with another person and taking their suggestions and such into consideration. Essentially it taught me how to stick through with it and work as a team.
